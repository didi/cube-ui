## Upload

> New in 1.3.0+

`Upload` component.

**Notice:** In this document, all the original File will be called **original file**, since the wrapped file object will be called **file object**. The structure of **file object** show as following:

| Attribute | Description | Type |
| - | - | - |
| name | file name | String |
| size | file size | Number |
| url | file url, created by URL.createObjectURL, for preview | String |
| base64 | file base64 value, the value is equaled to the original file's base64 value. It is `''` by default, but you can have some plugins to added this `base64` value, like the compress plugin below | String |
| status | file status, one of: ready, uploading, success, error | String |
| progress | file progress, number 0~1 | Number |
| file | the original file | File |
| response | response data(try to parse to JSONï¼‰| Object/Array/String |
| responseHeaders | all response headers | String |

### Example

- Basic usage

  ```html
  <cube-upload
    action="//jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/"
    :simultaneous-uploads="1"
    @files-added="filesAdded" />
  ```
  ```js
  export default {
    methods: {
      filesAdded(files) {
        const maxSize = 1 * 1024 * 1024 // 1M
        for (let k in files) {
          const file = files[k]
          if (file.size > maxSize) {
            file.ignore = true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Set `action` to configure the upload target URL for the multipart POST request.

  Set `simultaneous-uploads` to configure the max number of files uploading simultaneously .

  The `files-added` event is used for file validation, and you can filter file by setting `file.ignore = true`.

- Compress and uploaded through Base64

  ```html
  <cube-upload
    ref="upload2"
    :action="action2"
    :simultaneous-uploads="1"
    :process-file="processFile"
    @file-submitted="fileSubmitted"></cube-upload>
  ```
  ```js
  import compress from '../modules/image'
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        action2: {
          target: '//jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/',
          prop: 'base64Value'
        }
      }
    },
    methods: {
      processFile(file, next) {
        compress(file, {
          compress: {
            width: 1600,
            height: 1600,
            quality: 0.5
          }
        }, next)
      },
      fileSubmitted(file) {
        file.base64Value = file.file.base64
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The `action` is an object which contains `target` and `prop`. the `prop` could configure which property  in file object will be uploaded).

  The `process-file` is a function which is used to process the original file, like compress, `next` must be called with the processed file.

  The `file-submitted` event will be trigged after the file is processed and added to the `upload.files` with a parameter -- the file object.

### Props configuration

| Attribute | Description | Type | Accepted Values | Demo |
| - | - | - | - | - |

| auto | whether auto start upload | Boolean | true | - |
